## The Book In 3 Sentences
Behavioral Addictions, a mechanism to respond to a taxing physical experience psychologically, is closely associated with environmental context and with dopamine. Behavioral addiction consists of 6 ingredients: compelling __goals__ that are just beyond reach, irresistible and unpredictable positive __feedback__, a sense of incremental __progress__ and improvement, tasks that become slowly more difficult over time i.e. __escalation__, unresolved tensions that demand resolution in the form of __cliffhangers__ and strong __social interactions__ and connections. The ways to solve behavioral addiction are nipping it at birth, creating good habit architectures that divert time and energy from bad habits and gamifying those good habits.

## My 411
Another great recommendation by Brian Johnson's optimize.me, Irresistible by Adam Alter is well researched, easy to follow and filled to the brim with extremely pertinent examples and terrifyingly sobering statistics of how behaviorally addicted we are onto technology. By taking a "meta" view of what is behavioral addiction, what causes it and how to solve it, Adam Alter provides a plethora of studies and solutions to this pervasive problem. 

What I thoroughly appreciated about the book was the large number of personal examples the author used in each of the sections; learning about the author's struggle with addiction made the listen all the more worthwhile. Some of the extreme examples were eye-opening and scary for example, a gaming addict who did nothing but play World of Warcraft for 300+ days.

In the end, the author doesn't advocate for the complete expulsion of technology but a balanced approach that extirpates the addictive aspect of it in an effort to spend more time doing more meaningful enriching activities. I highly recommend this book! 

## Notes
1. __What Is Behavioral And Where Did It Come From__
   1. Behavioral addictions arise when a person can’t resist a behavior, which, despite addressing a deep psychological need in the short-term, produces significant harm in the long-term.
   2. Discovered the 'pleasure centre' of the brain. They implanted a small probe, which delivered a burst of electric current to each rat’s brain when the rat pressed a metal bar.
