## The Book In 3 Sentences
There is a science of getting rich and sticking to the steps anyone, regardless of environment and background, can attain riches. Faith and purpose of your vision that's rooted deeply in a creative rather than a competitive mindset mixed with gratitude gets you rich. It's only by acting on your vision by doing every day all that can be done that day - taking care to do each act in a successful man­ner over a period of time is how richness is actualized.

A quick read, "The Science Of Getting Rich" is one of the vanguards of the "you have to believe that you have it to get it" ideology. I personally liked the book as it is encouraging, optimistic and promulgates holding true to your vision and purpose without letting the things out of your control affect you. This is one of few unique books that is a cusp of spirituality and capitalism (one might think those ideologies are mutually exclusive) and that's what made this an interesting and out-of-the-ordinary read; the refreshing notion that "you don't have to give up all riches to be spiritual" is promoted throughout the book.

A critique one might hear is the dogmatic nature of the lessons where readers are required to reject a scientific attitude of disbelief and take every single lesson as truth.

My favorite part of the book is about the negatives of the competitive mindset and how one should adopt the creative mindset to become the best version of yourself and help others and yourself attain riches i.e. getting rich isn't a zero sum game.

The Secret, the popular book and documentary on Netflix, filched a majority of the ideas from this book. I prefer this book to the Secret as it provides extremely clear cut and structured advice rather than long winded descriptions. 

Overall, I would recommend this short but insightful book!
