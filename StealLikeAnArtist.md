## The Book In 3 Sentences

Nothing is original as it's built on things before and therefore, copy your heroes and transform their work into something of value for others. Keep a journal, log book, a calendar and a notepad for keeping track of new ideas, noting interesting things that have transpired to spark more ideas and a way to track your experiences. Creativity is about subtraction and it's boring routine that induces it further.

## My 411

The first of the "Steal Like An Artist" trilogy by Austin Kleon, Steal like An Artist was a short, albeit insightful read. Clear cut gems of advice wisdom presented as a lucidly as possible was the format of the book - kind of like a coffee table book for philosophers and I like it! 

My favorite part of the book was all the amazing quotes from eclectic sources that galvanized the lessons from each chapter. The nugget sized life lessons were definitely worth it - this might be the shortest audiobook I came across spanning just an hour! I plan to finish the rest of this trilogy as I did enjoy this book.
