## The Book In 3 Sentences
We have the key within us to overcome life's hurdles and are all subjected to the law of cause and effect as we are all interconnected with all other beings and the environment in the universe. The way to happiness in life is through achieving a state of Buddhahood by chanting ``Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo`` and thereby changing ourselves to view every obstacle as a growing opportunity. By living a happy life by being the best version of ourselves, we can die happily and without any fear or regrets.

## My 411
This book is overflowing with practical wisdom! I have always been interested in the teachings of Buddhism and this book didn't disappointment (in fact, left me wanting more) in helping me get to the kernel of Nichiren Buddhism. "The message is simple: Chant ``Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo`` sincerely and consistently to get rewarded." - as an inveterate skeptic I would have stopped when I read this (paraphrased) sentence and not continued but the explanations that followed made the entire reading process all the more rewarding. More in the notes below.

What makes this book great is the simplicity by which an otherwise seemingly challenging philosophical concept is presented; the ingredients of the secret sauce are the simple language and pertinent examples used. My favorite part of the book was the analogies used to lucidly explain concepts that might be misinterpreted. __Swan's legs__ to represent constant practice that gets rewarded with bliss and __Cherry blossoms__ awaiting to bloom in the winter to represent reincarnation after death conjured up vivid imagery that made crystallization of the concepts even better. 

Another aspect of the book I enjoyed despite by initial skepticism was the congruence of the teachings of Nichiren Buddhism and science particularly, quantum physics that expounds the wave-particle duality of matter subject to constant change. The adroit way the authors weaved a simple explanation of the congruence of the law of constant flux of all existence in Buddhism and Quantum physics was impeccable!

I, also, thoroughly enjoyed reading the foreword by Herbie Hancock as well lending credence to practical nature of the underlying philosophy. His encouraging words were underscored by practical wisdom that set the reading on the right foot.

This book left me feeling empowered and with a new and improved outlook on how and more importantly, __why__ I should view obstacles as fertile ground for growth. Thanks for the great recommendation! I have a feeling I'll be back for seconds.

        2.  Best predictor of life satisfaction is __Satisfaction with Self__.
            1.  "True happiness is not the absence of suffering: You cannot have day after day of clear skies. True happiness lies in building a self that stands dignified and indomitable. Happiness doesn’t mean having a life free from all difficulties but that whatever difficulties arise, without being shaken in the least, you can summon up the unflinching courage and conviction to fight and overcome them."
        3. Those who had a strong “internal locus of control” typically achieved more in school, coped better with stress, and lived more happily.
    14.  __Optimism__
         1.   Optimists are healthier and more successful.
         2.  Buddhism teaches us to regard everything in a positive light, as an opportunity for growth, as the raw material for developing absolute happiness.
             1.  Individuals develop confidence in their power to transform even intense suffering into the raw material of happiness. With this power, every- thing is a benefit, an opportunity.
         3.  Loss of Hope is the WORST.
         4.  “True joy emerges ceaselessly from within your life while you squarely bat- tle to overcome each storm of hardships. This kind of true joy gushes forth endlessly. You cannot enjoy a true and profound joy if you seek only to indulge yourself in comfortable situations where you don’t have to experience severe hardships.”
    15. __Living With Purpose__
        1.  “To be filled each day with a rewarding sense of exhilaration and purpose. A sense of tasks accomplished and deep fulfillment — people who feel this way are happy.”
        2.  Real happiness is linked to pledging oneself to a great purpose. One who lives this way is strong, strong enough to be happy under any circumstances. 
            1.  One who lives this way experiences a sense of fulfillment in the depths of life unaffected by the surrounding constant change.
        3. “The mission or objective that you have taken on yourself must be in accord with the happiness of oneself and others. That is what makes absolute happiness possible.”
        4. Real happiness is not about simply having lofty ideals, but about taking action to fulfill one’s purpose or mission in life on behalf of other.
    16. __Human Transformation__
        1.  What keeps people in the lower six worlds are delusions arising from what Buddhism terms the “three poisons” — 
            1.  Greed
            2.  Anger
            3.  Foolishness
        2.  Chant ``Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo``.
5.  __Chapter 5: Relationships That Work__
    1.  Buddhist practice is not a solitary activity - we need the compassionate interaction with others; compassion towards others is a virtual prerequisite for enlightenment.
    2.  A person of wisdom tries to invigorate and bring out the best in others.
    3.  A person in the state of Buddhahood respects others’ individuality, and desires that they manifest their unique qualities as well.
    4.  Having satisfying, enduring relationships contributes greatly to our happiness.
    5.  Relationships can be a source of suffering and pain as we lack the wisdom to make them work. 
        1.  Frequently, we enter them for reasons not conducive to their survival.
    6.  Developing successful relationships begins with accepting full responsibility for your life and your life and your role in those relationships.
    7.  Buddhism teaches that one’s environment reflects his or her inner state of life. Buddhism suggests that if you are surrounded by turkeys, it’s very likely that instead of the eagle you may think yourself to be, you are, in fact, a turkey yourself. By extension, your environment => turkey farm.
    8.  It is not your fellow turkeys that are preventing you from soaring, it is that you must transform yourself into an eagle you desire to be.
    9. It is our unenlightened mind that is flawed and not _US_.
    10. We are not responsible for the behavior of others, only for ourselves.
        1.  Since we have control only over our lives, we have the power to do something about relationships.
        2.  If you are suffering, it is your problem to solve, not someone elses.
    11. People spend too much effort trying to change other's behavior too make relationships work.
        1.  Ultimately this is as futile as cleaning the mir- ror in an attempt to clean your face.
    12. Relationships we have formed are a reflection of our own state of life.
    13. The key to transforming relationships lies in the process of transforming ourselves. Since the only person whose behavior you control is yourself, use that power to the utmost. Work from the inside out.
    14. 3 Stages In Character Development Of All Humans
        1. Dependent
        2. Independent
        3. Contributive or Interdependent
    15. Independence, the stand-alone self, can be a happy state because we are in control, a necessary condition of happiness.
    16. Arrogance and companionship don’t mix well.
    17. Dependent Relationships: "I'll love you as long as you give me what I need".
        1.  Life in this sort of relationship can only be an emotional roller coaster, climbing to exhilarating highs and plunging into desperate lows.
    18. Happiness in any situation cannot be achieved with- out a sense of control.
    19.  “Happiness is not something that someone else, like a boyfriend or girlfriend, can give to us, we have to achieve it for ourselves. And the only way to do so is by developing our character and capacity as human beings, by fully realizing our own potential. If we sacrifice our growth and talent for love, we absolutely will not find happiness.”
    20.  The goal is to become the master of our relationships.
         1.   Expecting relationships to bear fruit immediately is unrealistic and actually counterproductive to establishing a long-term bond.
    21.  Relationships are fertile ground for growth, development, maturation and strengthening of our own character.
    22.  Hell in relationships comes from trying to change the behavior of anyone but yourself.
    23.  It is only when we stop trying to control others that we gain the power to actually influence them.
    24.  The only meaningful comparison is between our life today, yesterday, last month or last year.
    25.  Ultimately, we create true happiness by developing our lives to the fullest. 
         1.   Trying to be somebody else or what you think somebody else wants you to be is a sure way to suffer. Be who you are and be it well. Be where you are and be there well. 
         2.  If you are continually growing and advancing, you have the greatest life in the world because you know tomorrow will always be better than today.
    26.  People do not respond well to constant criticism and negativity. 
         1.   People love praise and appreciation.
    27.  __Career__
         1.   Doing well in your career depends primarily on __attitude__.
         2.   There are 3 kinds of value: beauty, gain and good.
              1. Beauty - finding a job you like.
              2. Gain - Earn a salary that supports your daily life.
              3. Good - Helps others and benefits society.
         3.  Become indispensible and create harmony on the job.
6.  __Chapter 6: Buddhism and Health__
    1. Enlightenment or Buddhahood is the ultimate medicine because through its virtues we draw from forth the innate wisdom and life force necessary to cure mental and physical ills.
    2. Chief aim of Buddhist medicines is to help individuals develop their natural self-healing powers by cultivating enlightenment.
    3. Solution for illness is within i.e. we possess the power to transform negativity to a neutral or even a positive state.
    4. Health is not simply the absence of illness rather a state of being that enables us to overcome illness and the obstacles to our health. 
    5. Because both health and illness exist as potentialities within us, we can make ourselves sick, and we can make ourselves well.
    6. Illness can be an opportunity to build an even more strong foundation.
    7. Three guidelines of curing a sickness:
       1. See a good doctor
       2. Get good medicine
       3. Be an excellent patient
    8. "I can defeat my sickness and change the poison in my body into medicine".
    9. There is oneness of mind and body.
       1. Expectations and beliefs have a powerful effect on the workings of the body, distorted thinking (delusion) necessarily will have a powerful impact on one’s health and capacity to overcome illness.
       2. Bad beliefs: 
          1. Holding others responsible for your own pain.
          2. Interpreting others’ unknowable thoughts and actions in a way that is negative toward you or believing others think more strongly about you than is actually the case. 
          3. Deducing fatalistic general conclusions based on specific occurrences or limited information.
    10. Key lines in ridding ourselves of our attachments to deluded / non-life affirming values.
    11. Life-force is what heals our sickness.
    12. Good health begins with self-love.
    13. Positive aspects of chanting ``Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo`` in terms of health:
        1.  The Mystic Law has the power to open the self
            1.  We have an infinite reservoir of life-force. By chanting, we tap into it.
        2.  The Mystic Law has the power to revitalize
        3.  The Mystic Law has the power to endow
7.  __Chapter 7: Dealing with Death__
    1.  The challenge presented by the issue of death is to find the most valuable way to live. 
    2.  Last 3 sufferings of Buddhism are all linked to the suffering of death i.e. sickness, old age and death itself.
    3.  A vicious cycle in the mind and heart is caused by apprehensions of death.
    4.  “We should first learn about the issue of dying and then study all other affairs.”
        1. Overcome the fear of death.
    5. Confrontation with death has been called the mother of philosophy. 
    6. Society that's firmly grounded in materialism: death is the final denial of all our material attributes, therefore, we fear it.
       1. Failing to pursue overcoming the fear of death is like spending our student years never considering what we want to do after graduating.
    7. In the context of the macrocosm, life can neither be created nor destroyed.
       1. Life and death are alternating aspects of our real selves.
       2. "Myo represents death, and ho, life. Living beings that pass through the two phases of life and death are the entities of the Ten Worlds, or the entities of Myoho-renge-kyo.... No phenomena — either heaven or earth, yin or yang, the sun or .. or any of the worlds from hell to Buddhahood — are free from the two phases of life and death. Life and death are simply the two functions of Myoho-renge-kyo."
       3. All things that physically manifest themselves in this life must withdraw into a state of latency upon their extinction or death.
       4. When the physical body ceases to function, our lives enter a new phase, a period of dormancy followed by rebirth.
       5. Death is necessary.
    8. The Nine Levels of Consciousness
       1. Sight
       2. Hearing
       3. Smell
       4. Taste
       5. Touch
       6. 6th combines the first five into coherent signals and makes judgements about the external world.
          1. Together, the first 6 form the conscious mind.
       7. __Mano-consciousness__: Discerns the inner world.
          1. "I think, therefore, I am"
       8. __Allaya-consciousness__: Storehouse of memories across different births.
          1. Physical memories fade with the death of the physical brain.
          2. The allaya-consciousness keeps _all_ memories.
       9. __Amala-consciousness__ or __Buddhahood__: actualized potential - you are ONE with the universe. Absolute purity.
    9.  We die well if we lived well.
        1.  Buddhism is primarily concerned with living a happy life to die happily in an eventual goal to achieve Buddhahood.
8.  __Chapter 8: Putting It All Into Practice__
    1.  We have the key, within us, to overcome life's hurdles and be happy.
    2.  We are interconnected with all other beings and the environment in the universe.
    3.  We are subject to the law of cause and effect.
