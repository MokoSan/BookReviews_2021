## The Book In 3 Sentences
Honesty, right attitude, interest in the other person by listening more than talking and openness about yourself are fundamental ingredients in becoming a good talker. Overcome your own shyness and practice talking to others to gain experience and confidence and avoid yes / no questions - the best type of question is "why". Find common ground with the other people, always pay attention to your body language and make natural eye contact with others.

## My 411
An incredible book with a wealth of information, "How To Talk To Anyone, Anytime, Anywhere" by the late legend, Larry King has substantially helped my naturally introverted side get better at socializing and indulging in more meaningful conversation. Imbued with practical advice this book teaches you how to be a better conversationalist in a variety of situations including at cocktail parties, at job interviews, at your place of work or when you are out in public with a stranger. 

My favorite part of listening to this book was how Larry King talking about his own personal stories and how they relate with the fundamentals/rules/tips he covers. With innumerable interviews under his belt, he has a treasure trove of information to offer and he does it in such a tastefully lucid manner that I have planned to listen to this book again. Highly recommend this one to any one who wants to improve their communication skills even if they think they are veterans at the game.
